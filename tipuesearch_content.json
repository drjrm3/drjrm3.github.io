Sorry, I had to - it's my first blog post. I have tried blogging before and used wordpress, etc. (I even tried Blogger back in the day), but now I actually built a blog with Pelican and I'm pretty excited that it actually seems to work. Note that I'm not a web developer (yet!). I'm more of a HPC developer / mathematician so putting together a website is pretty exciting for me. I'll try to keep this blog on a reasonably professional level, mostly discussing tech and math. However, I reserve the right to blog about my adventures as a husband and father of two. I might even slip in a dad joke or two.","loc":"/posts/2019/Nov/07/hello-world/","url":"/posts/2019/Nov/07/hello-world/"}]};
